    title: "Introduction to Open Reproducible Science Workflows"
    authors: "Leah Wasser, Jenny Palomino, Elsa Culler"
    excerpt: |
      In section one of this textbook, you will learn about **open reproducible science**. The lessons in this book use a suite of open source tools that are often used in open reproducible science workflows including `Bash`/`Shell`, `Python`, and the `Jupyter` ecosystem, including `Jupyter Notebook`. You will also learn about best practices for open reproducible projects and workflows.
    objective: |
      * Define open reproducible science and explain its importance.
      * Describe how reproducibility can benefit you and others.
      * Identify best practices for open reproducible science projects and workflows. 
      * Run `bash` commands in the terminal to work with files and directories on your computer.
      * Launch and navigate the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard to access and create `Jupyter Notebook` files.
      * Run cells within `Jupyter Notebook` to execute `Python` code and render `Markdown` text.
