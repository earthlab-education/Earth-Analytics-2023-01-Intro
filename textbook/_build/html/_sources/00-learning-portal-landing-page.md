# Welcome to the **Learning Portal** at Earthlab, University of Colorado Boulder

## Who are we?

This textbook is designed and maintained by the education team at <a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu" target = "_blank"> the University of Colorado Boulder Earthlab</a>. We use it for our <a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate?utm_source=eds" target = "_blank">Earth Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a>, as well as our other programs and workshops. 
    
## How to use these books

These books is meant to be both **self-guided curriculum** and a **reference tool**. You can choose to work your way through one chapter at a time to gain a solid foundation in scientific programming, or you can **search for what you need right now**. Either way, we'll provide you with all the tools and data you need to start coding today.

We will do our best to explain the key principles of each topic. However, we (and our students), have found that much of what we teach in these books must be learned through **practice, experiment, and play**. We recommend trying out as much code as you can as you work through this book. See what happens when you change things! We've provided you with several places where you can modify and run code:
  1. Turning on live coding at the top of the page to code, right here in the textbook.
  2. Download a page as a Jupyter Notebook so you can run it in your own environment. We maintain a `conda` environment and matching `docker` container that will let you run all of the code in this book.
  3. Copy and paste a snippet into your own code.

We know you can improve our code -- and we'd love to hear from you when you do.
