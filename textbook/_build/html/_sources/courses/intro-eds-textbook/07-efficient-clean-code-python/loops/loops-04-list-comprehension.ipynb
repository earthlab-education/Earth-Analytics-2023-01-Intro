    "## List Comprehension Basics\n",
    "Loops, as you've seen, can be a very powerful tool to manipulate and create data. \n",
    "However, they're not the only option when it comes to these types of operations. \n",
    "Another popular method is list comprehension. It's a concise and quick way to modify \n",
    "values in a list and create a new list from the output. It works in a similar way to \n",
    "a `for` loop, but has slightly different syntax. One can be translated to the other fairly \n",
    "easily! \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform list comprehension, you have to put the for loop and the desired outcome inside \n",
    "of a list. So this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_list = []\n",
    "for i in list:\n",
    "    new_list.append(i*i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "becomes this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_list = [i*i for i in list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the code takes up less space, and uses similar words to the for loop. \n",
    "However, the execution is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits and Downsides of List Comprehension\n",
    "There are many pros and cons to consider when using list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: \n",
    "* Generally faster than for loops, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "* Takes less code to write and fits in a smaller space than a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "* Can be less legible in certain situations.\n",
    "* Can be harder to implement for complicated operations in for loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will go over things you learned how to do with traditional `for` \n",
    "loops and see how to do them with list comprehension. "

    "## Time Saved with List Comprehension\n",

    "list comprehensions are almost always faster than for loops when performing operations. \n",
    "Below, the same operation is performed by list comprehension and by for loop. It's a simple \n",
    "operation, it's just creating a list of the squares of numbers from 1 to 50000. From the \n",
