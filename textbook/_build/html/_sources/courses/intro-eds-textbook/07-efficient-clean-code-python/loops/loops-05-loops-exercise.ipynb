If you remember, `%` will get the remainder of a number divided by another number. So, to see if a number is even, the code `n%2 == 0` will return `True` if `n` is even, and `False` if `n` is odd.\n",
    "2. The `while` loop will run until the input number equals one. But you also need to remember not to run the code on the number if it does equal one. So in the odd calculation, make sure that the number doesn't equal one before you run the calculation on it. \n",
