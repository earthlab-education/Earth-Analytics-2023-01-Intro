    "## About Pull Requests And Two Ways to Create A Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pull request** (referred to as a **PR**) is a way for you to suggest changes\n",
    "to a repository that are visible and can be easily reviewed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pull requests are specific to **GitHub** and can be implemented in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You submit changes to another repository based upon changes that you made to a fork (i.e. copy owned by you) of that repository.\n",
    "2. You submit changes to an existing repository using a branch (i.e. a copy of the main branch of repository). Branches are not discussed in this chapter but you will learn more about branches as you get into more advanced **GItHub** topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Pull Request Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this page, pretend that you are working with your colleague\n",
    "on a project. You have been asked to make some changes to a README.md file\n",
    "in your collaborator's repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin this task, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <a href=\"{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/fork-clone-github-repositories/#create-a-copy-of-other-users-files-on-githubcom-forking\">Create a fork</a> of your colleague's repository. \n",
    "2. Clone that fork to your local computer and begin to work on the README.md file in a text editor.\n",
    "3. When you are done editing the text file locally on your computer, you save the file and `git add` and `git commit` your changes using git.\n",
    "4. Finally, you `git push` those changes back up to your fork of your colleague's repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the changes are in your fork but you want to suggest those changes as updates to your colleague's repository. To do this, you submit a pull request with the changes to your colleague's repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "differences between the file you submitted, compared to the file that exists\n",
    "in a repository. These changes are called **diffs** (short for differences).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Your colleague will review the changes.  If they would like a few additional changes, they will\n",

    "## The Anatomy of a Diff (Difference Between Two Files)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a diff represents differences between two files in **git**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** keeps track of changes through additions and deletions on a character by\n",
    "character and line by line basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, pretend that the word \"great\" is spelled incorrectly in a file, and you wish\n",
    "to fix the spelling. The edit that you will make is: **graet** is changed to **great**\n",
    "\n",
    "The change above represents 2 character deletions and 2 additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word great has 5 characters, so the number of characters is not changing in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you are deleting: `ae` and replacing those two characters with `ea`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you edit files in a version control system like **git**, it is tracking each character\n",
    "addition and deletion. These tracked changes are what you see in a diff when you submit a pull\n",
    "request."

    "## GitHub Pull Requests Support Open Science and Open Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "A pull request (herein referred to as **PR**) is ideal to use as a collaboration\n",
    "tool. A **PR** is similar to a “push” that you would make to a repository that\n",
    "you own. However, a **PR** also allows for a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It allows you to contribute to another repo without needing administrative privileges to make changes to the repository.\n",
    "2. It documents changes as they are made to a repository and as they address issues. It also makes those changes easily visible to anyone who may want to see them.\n",
    "3. It allows others to review your changes and suggest corrections, additions, and edits on a line by line basis to those changes as necessary.\n",
    "4. It supports and documents conversation between collaborators on the project.\n",
    "5. It allows repository administrators or code maintainers to control what gets added to the project repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note if you do not own the repository that you wish to modify, a **PR** is the\n",
    "only way that you can contribute changes to that repository.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Pull Request Terminology - Head vs. Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example above where you were submitting changes to the contributing.rst\n",
    "file in your colleague's repo. After pushing the changes to your fork, you are ready to make a pull request to your colleague's repo.  \n",
    "\n",

    "coming from (e.g. your fork). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key terms that you should know to set this\n",
    "up in Github: \n",
    "* **Base**: Base is the repository that will be updated. Changes will be added to this repository via the pull request. Following the example above, the base repo is your colleague's repo.\n",
    "* **Head**: Head is the repository containing the changes that will be added to the base. Following the example above, this is your repository (your fork of your colleague's repo).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to remember the difference between head and base is that the “head” is\n",
    "a**head** of the \"base\". Ahead means that there are changes in the head repo that\n",
    "the base repo does NOT have. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you need to add the changes from the **head**\n",
    " (your forked repo) to the **base** (your colleague's repo).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you begin a pull request, the head and base will auto-populate. It may\n",
