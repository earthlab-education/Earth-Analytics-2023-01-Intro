    "There are a few ways to update or sync your repo with the central repo (e.g. your colleague's repo).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can perform a \"Reverse Pull Request\" on GitHub. A reverse pull request will follow the same steps as a regular pull request. However, in this case, your fork becomes the **base** and your colleague's repo is the **head**. If you update your fork this way, you will then have to PULL your changes down to your local clone of the repo (on your computer) where you are working.  \n",
    "2. You can manually set or pull down changes from the central repo to your clone locally. This can be done in the Terminal. When you update your local clone, you will then need to push the changes or commits back up to your fork on **GitHub.com**.\n",

For example, if you set up SSH on your computer but are still getting prompted for a password everytime you try to run `git push` or `git pull`, it likely means that your remote has an HTTPS connection instead of an SSH connection. Alternatively, you won't be able to run `git pull` or `git push` if you are trying to access an HTTPS connection through an SSH remote. \n",
