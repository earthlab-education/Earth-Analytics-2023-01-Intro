    "## What are Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** arrays are a commonly used scientific data structure in **Python** that store data as a grid, or a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Python**, data structures are objects that provide the ability to organize and manipulate data by defining the relationships between data values stored within the data structure and by providing a set of functionality that can be executed on the data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the previous chapters, you used lists (another data structure in **Python**) to store values of monthly precipitation for Boulder, CO. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like **Python** lists, **numpy** arrays are also composed of ordered values (called elements) and also use indexing to organize and manipulate the elements in the **numpy** arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of **numpy** arrays is that all elements in the array must be the same type of data (i.e. all integers, floats, text strings, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists which do not require a specific **Python** package to be defined (or worked with), **numpy** arrays are defined using the `array()` function from the **numpy** package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To this function, you can provide a list of values (i.e. the elements) as the input parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`array = numpy.array([0.7 , 0.75, 1.85])`\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above creates a **numpy** array with a simple grid structure along one dimension. However, the grid structure of **numpy** arrays allow them to store data along multiple dimensions (e.g. rows, columns) that are relative to each other. This dimensionality makes **numpy** arrays very efficient for storing large amounts of data of the same type and characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences Between Python Lists and Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Python** lists and **numpy** arrays have similarities in that they are both collections of values that use indexing to help you store and access data, there are a few key differences between these two data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unlike a **Python** list, all elements in a **numpy** arrays must be the same data type (i.e. all integers, decimals, text strings, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because of this requirement, **numpy** arrays support arithmetic and other mathematical operations that run on each element of the array (e.g. element-by-element multiplication). Recall that lists cannot have these numeric calculations applied directly to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unlike a **Python** list, a **numpy** array is not edited by adding/removing/replacing elements in the array. Instead, each time that the **numpy** array is manipulated in some way, it is actually deleted and recreated each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Numpy** arrays can store data along multiple dimensions (e.g. rows, columns) that are relative to each other. This makes **numpy** arrays a very efficient data structure for large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensionality of Numpy Arrays \n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** arrays can be:\n",
    "* one-dimensional composed of values along one dimension (resembling a **Python** list).\n",
    "* two-dimensional composed of rows of individual arrays with one or more columns.\n",
    "* multi-dimensional composed of nested arrays with one or more dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will work with one-dimensional and two-dimensional **numpy** arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **numpy** arrays, brackets `[]` are used to assign and identify the dimensions of the **numpy** arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "This first example below shows how a single set of brackets `[]` are used to define a one-dimensional array. "
