    "excerpt": "In section one of this textbook, you will learn about **open reproducible science**. The lessons in this book use a suite of open source tools that are often used in open reproducible science workflows including `Bash`/`Shell`, `Python`, and the `Jupyter` ecosystem, including `Jupyter Notebook`. You will also learn about best practices for open reproducible projects and workflows.\n",
    "objective": "* Define open reproducible science and explain its importance.\n* Describe how reproducibility can benefit you and others.\n* Identify best practices for open reproducible science projects and workflows. \n* Run `bash` commands in the terminal to work with files and directories on your computer.\n* Launch and navigate the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard to access and create `Jupyter Notebook` files.\n* Run cells within `Jupyter Notebook` to execute `Python` code and render `Markdown` text.",
