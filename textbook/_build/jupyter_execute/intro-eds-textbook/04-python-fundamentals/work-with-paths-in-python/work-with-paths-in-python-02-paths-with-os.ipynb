    "\n",
    "1. set things up in the rare case that your machine dies.\n",
    "2. move your workflow to a cloud environment or high performance computing infrastructure.\n",
    "2. share your project and collaborate with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to consider when creating paths that can make reproducibility\n",

    "* **C:\\\\\\Users\\\\\\username\\\\\\earth-analytics\\\\\\data** on Windows\n",

    "The noticeable differences are the identification of the home directory (e.g. `/home/username` or `C:\\\\Users\\\\username`) and the direction and number of slashes. \n",
