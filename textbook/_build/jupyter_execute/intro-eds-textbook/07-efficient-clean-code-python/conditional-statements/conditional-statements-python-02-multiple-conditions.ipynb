    "## Conditional Statements With Alternative Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "On the previous page, you learned how to write conditional statements that check for one condition before executing some code: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    print(\"Condition is true.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Condition is false (i.e. not true).\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can expand on this syntax to check for an alternative condition with an `elif` statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    some code here\n",
    "elif alternative_condition:\n",
    "    some other code here\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    some final code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first condition provided with the `if` statement is not satisfied (i.e. results in value of `False`) , then **Python** will check the condition provided with the `elif` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition for `elif` is satisfied, then the code provided with it will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if neither the `if` nor `elif` conditions are satisfied, then the code provided with `else` will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    print(\"First condition is true.\")\n",
    "elif alternative_condition:\n",
    "    print(\"First condition is not true but alternative condition is true.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Neither of these conditions is true, so this statement is printed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spacing and Execution of Code Lines \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the `print` code in the examples above can be replaced by any code that will execute in **Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the code provided with the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements gets longer, it is common to add blank lines to make it easier to see which code will be executed with whitch statement. However, the indentation remains an important part of the syntax of the conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the examples below to see `elif` in action and see how `print` statements can be replaced with other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, `x` is compared to `y`. The first condition checks whether `x` is less than `y`, while the alternative condition checks whether `x` is greater than `y`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As `x` is equal to a value less than `y`, the first condition is satisfied, which results in a value of 5 being added to `x`."
