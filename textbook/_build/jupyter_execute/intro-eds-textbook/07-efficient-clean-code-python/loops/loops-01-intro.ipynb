    "A loop is a sequence of operations that are performed over and over in some \n",
    "specified order. Following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of clean \n",
    "coding, loops can help you to eliminate repetition in code by replacing \n",

    "execute the same code line or block until it reaches a specified end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of copying and pasting the same code over and over to run it multiple times (say, on multiple variables or files), you can create a loop that contains one instance of the code and that executes that code block on a range or list of values that you provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following lines could be replaced by a loop that iterates \n",
    "over a list of variable names and executes the `print()` function until it \n",
    "reaches the end of the list:"
