    "## Install the Earth Analytics Python Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the `earth-analytics-python` environment, you will need to follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fork and clone a GitHub repository from `https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env` to your `earth-analytics` directory. \n",
    "    * This repository contains a file called `environment.yml` that contains the instructions to install the environment.\n",
    "    * For a refresher on forking/cloning repositories, see the section below on **Fork and Clone GitHub Repository** at the bottom of this lesson. \n",
    "2. If it's not already open, open the Terminal on your computer (e.g. Git Bash for Windows or Terminal on a Mac/Linux).\n",
    "3. In the Terminal, set your directory to the cloned `earth-analytics-python-env` dir using `cd` to change directories (e.g. `cd earth-analytics-python-env`).\n",
    "4. Once you are in the `earth-analytics-python-env` directory, you can create your environment. To do this run: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.\n",
    "    * Once the environment is installed you can activate it using: `conda activate earth-analytics-python`.\n",
    "5. To view a list of all conda environments available on your machine run: `conda info --envs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: **always make sure that the earth-analytics-python environment is activated** before doing work for lessons on this website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it takes time to install of the packages found in the earth-analytics-python environment as it needs to download and install each library. Also, you need to have internet access for this to run! \n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> **Data Tip:**\n",
    "The instructions above will only work if you run them in the directory where you placed the environment.yml file.\n",
    "{: .notice--success }\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Windows Users:** A reminder that the lessons on this website assume that you are using Git Bash as your primary terminal. \n",

    "## About Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a YAML (.yml) File?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work with conda, you can create custom lists that tell conda where to install libraries from, and in what order. You can even specify a particular version. \n",
    "\n",
    "You write this list using  <a href=\"http://yaml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">YAML</a> (Yet Another Markup Language). This is an alternative to using `pip` to install **Python** packages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous steps, you used a custom .yml list to install all of the **Python** libraries that you will need to complete the **Python** lessons on this website. This .yml list is customized to install libraries from the repositories and in an order that minimizes conflicts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into any issues installing the environment from the .yml, let us know! \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, explore your new conda environment. Hereâ€™s what part of the .yml file looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name: earth-analytics-python\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - python=3.7\n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "  # Core scientific python\n",
    "  - numpy\n",
    "  - matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice at the top of the file there is the environment name. This file has a few key parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name: the name of the environment that you will call when you want to activate the environment. The name `earth-analytics-python` is defined in the environment.yml file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Channels: this list identifies where packages will be installed from. There are many options including conda, conda-forge and pip. You will be predominately using conda-forge for the `earth-analytics-python` environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dependencies: Dependencies are all of the things that you need installed in order for the environment to be complete. In the example, **Python** version 3.7 is specified. The order in which the libraries should be installed is also specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have different **Python** environments on your computer. Conda allows you to easily jump between environments using a set of commands that you run in your terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of various commands to manage your conda environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed instructions for using these commands, see the Intro to Earth Data Science textbook page on <a href=\"{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/use-python-packages/use-conda-environments-and-install-packages/\">Installing Python Packages in Conda Environments</a>.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### View a List of All Installed Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a list of all installed conda environments by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "conda info --envs\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use a particular environment that you have installed on your computer, you need to activate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a **Python** package such as `geopandas` is only installed in the `earth-analytics-python` environment, and not the default conda environment, you will not be able to access it (e.g. import it to `Jupyter Notebook`), unless you have the `earth-analytics-python` environment activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate a Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**To activate an environment**, use the Terminal to navigate to your earth-analytics directory (e.g. `cd` to the directory). Then, type the following command to activate the environment (e.g. `earth-analytics-python`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate earth-analytics-python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Windows Users:** The first time that you try to run the \"conda activate\" command, you may be asked to configure Git Bash to use \"conda activate\". You can do this by running the command \"conda init bash\", just one time. After that, Git Bash will be configured to use \"conda activate\" moving forward.  \n",
    "{: .notice--success}\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is activated, the name of the activated environment will appear in parentheses on the left side of your terminal (e.g. `(earth-analytics-python`). \n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> **Data Tip:**\n",
    "Note that after you restart the Terminal, the `earth-analytics-python` environment is no longer active. You will need to activate the `earth-analytics-python` environment each time you start the Terminal by running the appropriate command provided above for your operating system. \n",
    "{: .notice--success}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate a Conda Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can deactivate a conda environment. Deactivating the environment switches you back to the default environment in your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Delete a Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever want to delete an envrionment, you must first deactivate that environment and then type: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env remove --name myenv\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "and replace `myenv` with the name of the environment that you want to remove. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember to never delete your root environment.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update a Conda Environment Using a YAML File\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created a conda environment, you can update it anytime by first activating the environment and then running the `conda env update` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below updates the `earth-analytics-python environment` using the `environment.yml` file. In this example, the command `conda env update` is run in the same directory that contains the `environment.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda activate earth-analytics-python\n",
    "$ conda env update -f environment.yml\n",
