    "Before you start this lesson, be sure that you have a computer with internet access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Information below is adapted from materials developed by <a href=\"https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template\" target = \"_blank\">Data Carpentry</a> and the <a href=\"https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\" target = \"_blank\">Conda documentation</a>.\n",

    "## Why Install Miniconda vs Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you learned that `Git` is a widely used tool for version control that allows you to track and manage changes to your files. `Git Bash` is used by Windows users to access both `Git` and `Bash` in one easy-to-install terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned that the conda package manager allows you to install `Python` packages on your computer as well as create and manage multiple `Python` environments, each containing different packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the conda package manager can be installed using either the Miniconda `Python` distribution or the Anaconda `Python` distribution, there are key differences between the two distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "|<a href=\"https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/\" target = \"_blank\">Anaconda</a> | <a href=\"https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\" target = \"_blank\">Miniconda</a>|\n",
    "|:--------|:---------|\n",
    "|Installs a long, pre-configured list of Python packages (many of which may not be used)  | Only installs a basic Python environment |\n",
    "|Installs Anaconda Navigator, Spyder, and many other tools that may not be needed | Only installs the conda package manager |\n",
    "|Installation can take up a lot time and space on your computer | Installation is quick and minimal |\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the time and space needed for installation (and to minimize potential conflicts between packages),\n",
    "you will use the Miniconda `Python` distribution to get started with only packages that you need to complete the `Python` lessons on this website. You can always add more `Python` packages as you need them!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can still install Miniconda on your computer (see additional details in the Setup Miniconda section below). Installing Miniconda will help you avoid dependency issues or conflicts when setting up the `earth-analytics-python` conda environment that you need for the `Python` lessons on this website.   \n",

    "## Bash Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Bash for Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/download/win\" target = \"_blank\">Git for Windows installer</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer by double-clicking on the downloaded file and by following the steps bellow:\n",
    "1. Click on “Run”.\n",
    "2. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "3. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "4. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "5. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "6. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "7. **Leave the selection on  \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd party software\"** and click on \"Next\". NOTE: If you forgot to do this, the programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens, rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.\n",
    "8. Click on \"Next\". \n",
    "9. **Leave the selection on  \"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings\"** and click on “Next”.\n",
    "10. Select the second option for **Use Windows' default console window** and click on \"Next\".\n",
    "11. Click on \"Next\".\n",
    "12. Click on \"Install\".\n",
    "13. When the install is complete, click on “Finish”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This installation will provide you with both `Git` and `Bash` within the `Git Bash` program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Bash for Mac OS X\n",
    "\n",
    "The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is `Bash`, so no need to install anything. You access `Bash` from the Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities). You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Bash for Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "The default shell is usually `Bash` but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening the Terminal and typing: `bash`. There is no need to install anything.\n",

    "## Git Setup\n",

    "**Even if you already have Anaconda for `Python` 2.x or 3.x setup, you will still need to set-up Miniconda.** You can install Miniconda following the instructions listed below, even if you already have a full Anaconda installation. (Note for Windows Users: if you already have Anaconda 3.7, you will be asked to confirm that you want to make the Miniconda installation the default conda on your computer when you follow step 6 of the Miniconda installation. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact your course instructor.) \n",

    "    * Note that even though the installation is for Miniconda, the installer uses the word Anaconda in these options.\n",
    "    * You will also see a message in red text that selecting “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable” is not recommended; continue with this selection to make using conda easier in Git Bash. If you have questions or concerns, please contact your instructor.\n",
